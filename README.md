# Tableau Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Tableau portfolio: a collection of interactive dashboards built using real-world datasets.
Each project demonstrates data storytelling, analytical thinking, and hands-on skills in data visualization.

These dashboards are created using a combination of:
- **SQL Server / Excel** for data cleaning and preparation
- **Tableau** for visual exploration and storytelling
- **Public datasets** across multiple domains
